I’m a tech lover who’s always curious about new stuff on the internet. I like messing around with different blogs and trying out static site generators like Hexo, Hugo, and Astro to build my own little corner online. I’m not a pro yet, but I’m all about learning and getting better at front-end and website building.

I’m really into Web3 — love “farming” and grabbing airdrops, catching all those chances to stack some digital assets. I also play around with crypto trading, keeping up with the market and figuring out trading tricks, trying to find my spot in this fast-moving world. Oh, and I’m also a Bitcoin miner, digging into mining and feeling the cool vibes of blockchain firsthand.

Looking ahead, I want to get deeper into Web3 tech, level up my coding skills, build cooler and more unique blogs, and make some real progress in the blockchain space.

Thanks a lot for checking me out and supporting me!
